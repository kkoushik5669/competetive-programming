//find the number of triangles in the graph with n nodes and m edges n<=100000 m <=100000
//hint:- assume that the degree of a heavy nodes is greater than root n then the number of heavy nodes are less than root n
//Assume a light node as a node with degree less than root n then the number of such nodes are greater than root n

# competetive-programming
//some things to remember:
1.int stoi (string s, size_t* position = 0, int base = 10)
2.when the question asks you about two teams and also some thing related to graphs then you must remind of bipartite graph.
3.auto it=vec.begin()+1;
    auto it2=vec.begin()+3;
    vec.erase(it,it2);
4.using dsu to find if a graph has cycle in it.
5.use 1ll<<34 instead of 1<<34.
6.if each node has exactly one outgoing directed edge .There is exactly one cycle in the given graph.
8.__lg(n) .
9.maximum prime gap donot excced 300.
10.string(c[i],codeforces[i]);
11.cirucular problems intuition- k%n;modulo n is the main part here.
Things to do:
1.Do stress testing.
2.Do get stuck on one approach.
3.Think and code.

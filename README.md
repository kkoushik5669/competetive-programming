# competetive-programming
//some things to remember:
1.int stoi (string s, size_t* position = 0, int base = 10)
2.when the question asks you about two teams and also some thing related to graphs then you must remind of bipartite graph.
3.auto it=vec.begin()+1;
    auto it2=vec.begin()+3;
    vec.erase(it,it2);
4.using dsu to find if a graph has cycle in it.
5.use 1ll<<34 instead of 1<<34.
6.partial_sum(a,a+5,b)
7.partial_sum(a,a+5,b,myfun);
8.maximum prime gap donot excced 300.
Things to do:
1.learning various string algorithms.

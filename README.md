# competetive-programming
//some things to remember:
1.int stoi (string s, size_t* position = 0, int base = 10)
2.when the question asks you about two teams and also some thing related to graphs then you must remind of bipartite graph.
3.auto it=vec.begin()+1;
    auto it2=vec.begin()+3;
    vec.erase(it,it2);
